# Face-Mask-Detection
Face Mask Detection with CNN 

COVID-19 has affected human life significantly causing a worldwide pandemic, this had made us
realize the detrimental effect of not wearing a face mask. The implementation of health protocols is still the most
effective way to prevent transmission, such as by wearing face masks. People are obliged to wear a mask
in public places. However, there are still people who do not adhere to health protocols. We aim to make
a model using deep learning algorithms to classify whether a person is wearing a mask, not wearing a
mask or whether the person is wearing a mask incorrectly. Wearing a mask incorrectly is also a major
catalyst in the widespread of COVID-19. We are planning to use a Convolutional neural network and it will
be trained on Kaggle dataset and use techniques such as augmentation to increase the accuracy of the
model, we will use some python packages such as OpenCV for reading the images and compare the
accuracy with the artificial neural network model and that will show the predominance of the
convolutional neural network to the artificial neural network and we also use some other libraries which
are common in machine learning and deep learning environment such as NumPy, pandas, Scikit-learn, and
Keras which isintegrated into TensorFlow. It will be testing our trainedmodel on still images and real-time
images using the webcam. We believe that with further research on our project it will become a very
important application in fieldssuch as transport facilities, crowded accommodation, markets, educational
institutions, and health care facilities.
